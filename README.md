## Challenge 1 - The Base Syntax

This challenge is part of React Complete Guide Course by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller.

Feel free to give me tips to write better code in React.JS!

Bye!

## Challenge Instructions
- Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput

- UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs

- Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)

- Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there

- Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component

- Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)

- Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event

- Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput

- Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username

- Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
